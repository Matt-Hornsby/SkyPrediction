### About this app

This app is being developed to help me learn the excellent Elixir programming language, and hopefully to provide a useful service to amateur stargazers. This app utilizes data from ClearDarkSky (http://cleardarksky.com) to determine if there will be clouds or other obstacles to viewing ISS flyovers, Iridium flares, and whatever else I can think of.
